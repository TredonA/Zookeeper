You are a zookeeper caring for a large number of animals. Everyday, you (the zookeeper) should provide food
and water for the animals. In order to minimize the expenses of the zoo, you are planning to devise a
systematic way to feed the animals. Your plan is to first make paths to each animal cage to deliver food, and
then to construct canals to provide fresh water to all animal cages. Your task is to identify the most efficient
routes for providing food and water to the animals.
